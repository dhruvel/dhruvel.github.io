## Projects

### [1. Blockchain DNS](https://github.com/dhruvel/Blockchain-DNS)

This project aims to investigate the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing domain storage and its implications for the future of the internet. It utilizes

**Technologies Used**:
  - **Blockchain Platform Selection**: The [Ethereum network](https://ethereum.org/en/) was chosen for its support for smart contracts and wide adoption.
  - **Smart Contract Development**: A [Smart Contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) was developed within the Ethereum Network to automate domain management tasks such as registration and overall administration. This self-executing contract streamlines the management process and enhances security by removing the need for human intervention.
  - **Interoperability Solutions**: Ensured compatibility with traditional DNS systems for widespread adoption. Implement interoperability solutions such as tools or protocols that bridge the gap between blockchain-based and traditional systems.
  - **dnserver.py Library**: Utilized the [dnserver.py](https://pypi.org/project/dnserver/) Python library to facilitate interaction between traditional DNS nameservers and the blockchain-based domain storage system. This library enables DNS nameservers to query the blockchain instead of other DNS nameservers.
  - **web3.py Library**: Used the [web3.py](https://pypi.org/project/web3/) Python library to provide a convenient interface for working with the Ethereum blockchain. This library facilitates interaction with the Ethereum network, sending transactions, and managing smart contracts.
  -  **Solidity Programming Language**: Developed the smart contract for the domain storage system using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), a high-level, statically typed language designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
  -   **Ethereum Network**: Leveraged the [Ethereum network](https://ethereum.org/en/) to build and deploy the smart contract. Utilize a test network ([Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) test network in this case) during development and testing for a safe and controlled environment to validate functionality, security, and performance 


### [2. DataDissolve](https://github.com/dhruvel/Data_Dissolve)

DataDissolve is a project aimed at secure and efficient data removal from storage systems. The project ensures data privacy by utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques and secure deletion methods, all while learning the native Android Development platform 

**Technologies Used**:
  - **Platform**: Utilized the [Android API](https://developer.android.com/reference) within the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) ecosystem and familiarized myself with the [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) app architecture
  - **Algorithms**: Implemented the basic algorithms for a few methods under [IEEE Standard for Sanitizing Storage](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2883/10277/), and also a custom method that allows a user to select the number of override passes and their overwritten data bits (can be static or [randomized](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html))


### [3. ASL Number Recognition](https://github.com/dhruvel/ASL-Number-Recognition)

This project focuses on recognizing [American Sign Language (ASL) numbers](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/numbersdiscussion.htm) using image processing and machine learning techniques. It aims to assist in communication for the hearing impaired by providing an automatic recognition system.

**Technologies Used**:
  - **Algorithms**: Use of prebuilt python libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) for numerical operations and handling image data arrays, [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html) for data vizualization and plotting results, [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/overview.html) for image processing tasks, [Collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) for handling dataset collections and the [Zoning method](https://github.com/zoningspace/zoning.space) for dividing images into zones and calculating the density of black pixels for recognition

### [4. Breathalyzer](https://github.com/dhruvel/Breathalyzer-CP320)

A portable breathalyzer device that measures blood alcohol content (BAC) levels and provides immediate feedback to the user. This project aims to promote responsible drinking and safety.

**Technologies Used**: 
  - **Hardware**: Used the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) as the primary microcontroller for the entire project, as well as the [MQ-3 Alcohol and Gas Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/MQ-3.pdf) to measure the alcohol level in the user's breath, a [PCF9591 ADC/DAC Converter](https://www.mpja.com/download/34689mpdata.pdf) to convert analog signals from MQ-3 Sensor to digital for the Raspberry Pi, the [Ultrasonic Ranging Module HC - SR04](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf) to determine whether the user is close enough to the device for accurate measurements, a [Servo Motor](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE1_EE/stores/sg90_datasheet.pdf) to externally indicate the user's alcohol level
  - **Software**: Used the [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/) library and [smbus](https://pypi.org/project/smbus2/) for the I/O and data processing within the Raspberry Pi
