### [1. Blockchain DNS](https://github.com/dhruvel/Blockchain-DNS)

This project aims to investigate the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing domain storage and its implications for the future of the internet

**Technologies Used**:
  - **Blockchain Platform Selection**: The [Ethereum network](https://ethereum.org/en/) was chosen for its support for smart contracts and wide adoption.
  - **Smart Contract Development**: A [Smart Contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) was developed within the Ethereum Network to automate domain management tasks such as registration and overall administration. This self-executing contract streamlines the management process and enhances security by removing the need for human intervention.
  - **Interoperability Solutions**: Ensured compatibility with traditional DNS systems for widespread adoption. Implement interoperability solutions such as tools or protocols that bridge the gap between blockchain-based and traditional systems.
  - **dnserver.py Library**: Utilized the [dnserver.py](https://pypi.org/project/dnserver/) Python library to facilitate interaction between traditional DNS nameservers and the blockchain-based domain storage system. This library enables DNS nameservers to query the blockchain instead of other DNS nameservers.
  - **web3.py Library**: Used the [web3.py](https://pypi.org/project/web3/) Python library to provide a convenient interface for working with the Ethereum blockchain. This library facilitates interaction with the Ethereum network, sending transactions, and managing smart contracts.
  -  **Solidity Programming Language**: Developed the smart contract for the domain storage system using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), a high-level, statically typed language designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
  -   **Ethereum Network**: Leveraged the [Ethereum network](https://ethereum.org/en/) to build and deploy the smart contract. Utilize a test network ([Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) test network in this case) during development and testing for a safe and controlled environment to validate functionality, security, and performance
